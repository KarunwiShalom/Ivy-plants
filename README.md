Analysis centered on Gross Profit, Sales, and Quantity of Goods that offers practical insights into the financial situation of a plant organization over a number of years.

# Overview

“Ivy Plant Inc.” is a fictional name I created to associate with the dataset. A large-scale company that sells three different groups of plants (indoor, outdoor, and landscape) to individuals and businesses worldwide. 

The dataset mimics the operations of a real-life plant company with similar operations. I downloaded it from a GitHub repository.

The dataset is an Excel file containing three tables split up into three tabs:

- Plant_FACT: This table contained sales invoices for the plants. It had a product I.D. and account I.D. column that could be connected with the other tables.
- Accounts: Containing all the information about each specific account included in the sale of the plants. An Account ID column was the unique identifier for the table.
- Plant hierarchy: This section had information about the products(plants). The products were assigned based on family, group, name, size, and type.

It contained 2000+ rows of data spanning three years (Jan. 2022 - Apr. 2024).
